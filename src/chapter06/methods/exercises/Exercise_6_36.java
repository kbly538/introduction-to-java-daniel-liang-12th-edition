/*
(Geometry: area of a regular polygon) A regular polygon is an n-sided polygon
in which all sides are of the same length and all angles have the same degree (i.e.,
the polygon is both equilateral and equiangular). The formula for computing the
area of a regular polygon is

Area = (n * s^2) / (4 * pi / 5)


Write a method that returns the area of a regular polygon using the following
header:

public static double area(int n, double side)

Write a main method that prompts the user to enter the number of sides and the
side of a regular polygon and displays its area.
