/*
(The Colorable interface) Design an interface named Colorable with a void
method named howToColor(). Every class of a colorable object must implement
the Colorable interface. Design a class named Square that extends
GeometricObject and implements Colorable. Implement howToColor to
display the message Color all four sides. The Square class contains a
data field side with getter and setter methods, and a constructor for constructing
a Square with a specified side. The Square class has a private double data field
named side with its getter and setter methods. It has a no-arg constructor to
create a Square with side 0, and another constructor that creates a Square with
the specified side.
Draw a UML diagram that involves Colorable, Square, and GeometricObject.
Write a test program that creates an array of five GeometricObjects. For each object
in the array, display its area and invoke its howToColor method if it is colorable.
