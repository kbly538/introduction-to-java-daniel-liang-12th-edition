/*
(The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a class
named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee. Make
Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name, address,
phone number, and e-mail address. A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore,
junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant. An employee has an
office, salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate class defined in Programming
Exercise 10.14 to create an object for date hired. A faculty member has office
hours and a rank. A staff member has a title. Override the toString method in
each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.
Draw the UML diagram for the classes and implement them. Write a test program
that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and invokes
their toString() methods.
