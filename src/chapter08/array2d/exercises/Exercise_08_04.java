/*
(Compute the weekly hours for each employee) Suppose the weekly hours for all
employees are stored in a two-dimensional array. Each row records an employeeâ€™s
seven-day work hours with seven columns. For example, the following array
stores the work hours for eight employees. Write a program that displays employees
and their total hours in decreasing order of the total hours.
