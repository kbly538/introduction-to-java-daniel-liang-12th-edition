/*
(Game: hangman) Write a hangman game that randomly generates a word and
prompts the user to guess one letter at a time, as presented in the sample run.
Each letter in the word is displayed as an asterisk. When the user makes a correct
guess, the actual letter is then displayed. When the user finishes a word, display
the number of misses and ask the user whether to continue to play with another
word. Declare an array to store words, as follows:
// Add any words you wish in this array
String[] words = {"write", "that",...};
