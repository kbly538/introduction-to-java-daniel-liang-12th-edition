/*********************************************************************************************************
 * (Geometry: two circles) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center
 * coordinates and radii of two circles and determines whether the second circle
 * is inside the first or overlaps with the first, as shown in Figure 3.10. (Hint: circle2
 * is inside circle1 if the distance between the two centers 6 = r1 âˆ’ r2
 * and circle2 overlaps circle1 if the distance between the two centers 6 =
 * r1 + r2. Test your program to cover all cases.)
