/*********************************************************************************************************
 * (Geometry: intersecting point) Two points on line 1 are given as (x1, y1) and
 * (x2, y2) and on line 2 as (x3, y3) and (x4, y4), as shown in Figure 3.8a and b.
 * The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by solving the following
 * linear equations:
 * (y1 - y2)x - (x1 - x2)y = (y1 - y2)x1 - (x1 - x2)y1
 * (y3 - y4)x - (x3 - x4)y = (y3 - y4)x3 - (x3 - x4)y3
 * This linear equation can be solved using Cramerâ€™s rule (see Programming
 * Exercise 3.3). If the equation has no solutions, the two lines are parallel (see
 * Figure 3.8c). Write a program that prompts the user to enter four points and displays
 * the intersecting point.
